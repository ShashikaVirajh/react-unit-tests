## Motivation

- This project was developed as a reference project to start working with @testing-library/react.
- Tried to provide a complete but simple example for the developers who want to easily get used to this
  amazing library.
- Tested components, utils and redux reducers and actions.

## Installation Guide

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShashikaVirajh/react-unit-tests-example.git
cd react-unit-tests-example
yarn
```

- To start the server after installation, run

```bash
yarn start

NOTE: If the APIs are not working, please add this chrome pluging.
CORS Unblock (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cors-unblock/lfhmikememgdcahcdlaciloancbhjino?hl=en)

Sometimes these APIs are not working. It must be due to the free plan of cocktaildb. Make sure to remove this plugging once the testing is done.

## Tech Stack Used

Typescript - for type safety
Redux tool kit - as the redux library
@testing-library/react - for testing
Mui - As the UI library
